# Repository Instructions

This repository contains the source code for the `@mateothegreat/svelte5-router` library.

Please follow these guidelines when analyzing the code:

1. Intake the documentation in the `docs/` directory.
2. Focus on the core functionality in the `src/lib/` directory.
3. Use the examples in the `demo/` directory to understand practical implementations.

Base your assumptions on the following facts:

- This is a svelte 5 library.
- This library uses advanced svelte 5 features such as runes, `$props()`, `$derived()`, etc.
- Do not use any previous knowledge of svelte 4 that negates the svelte 5 features such as stores, etc.
